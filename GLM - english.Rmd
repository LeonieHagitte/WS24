# I. Introduction

- **Statistical Framework:**
  - The General Linear Model (GLM) serves as a versatile statistical framework that includes various techniques such as correlation, linear regression, mediation, and moderation.

# II. Key Components of Statistical Analyses

- **Dependent Variable (DV):**
  - The outcome variable under investigation.
  - **How** does the choice of the DV influence the selection of statistical analyses?

- **Independent Variables (IVs):**
  - Factors or predictors that may influence the dependent variable.
  - **What** considerations are important when selecting independent variables?

- **Linear Relationship:**
  - Many analyses assume a linear relationship between variables.

- **Normal Distribution of Residuals:**
  - Residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) should follow a normal distribution.

- **Homoscedasticity:**
  - Residuals should exhibit constant variance across different levels of independent variables.

# III. Visualizing and Analyzing Data

- **Scatterplots:**
  - Visualize relationships between variables, aiding in the selection of appropriate analyses.

- **Residual Plots:**
  - Assess the assumptions of normal distribution and homoscedasticity.

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - **Description:**
    - **Objective:** Evaluate the strength and direction of linear relationships between continuous variables.
    - **Suitability:** Correlation analysis is suitable when exploring the association between two continuous variables.
    - **Interpretation:** The correlation coefficient (r) ranges from -1 to 1. A positive (negative) value indicates a positive (negative) linear relationship, with 0 indicating no linear relationship. The closer the absolute value of r is to 1, the stronger the linear relationship.
  - **Data Table Interpretation:**
    - Examine the correlation coefficient (r) and its significance level.
    - Identify the direction (positive/negative) and strength of the correlation.
    - Consider interpreting with caution if assumptions are violated.

- **Regression Analysis:**
  - **Description:**
    - **Objective:** Predict the dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
    - **Insights:** Regression provides insights into the nature and strength of relationships between variables, allowing the prediction of one variable based on others.
  - **Data Table Interpretation:**
    - Examine coefficients for each independent variable.
    - Evaluate the significance of coefficients and interpret their direction.
    - Assess the R-squared value for the proportion of variance explained.

- **Mediation Analysis:**
  - **Description:**
    - **Objective:** Investigate indirect effects through a mediator variable.
    - **Cruciality:** Mediation analysis is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms by which an independent variable influences a dependent variable.
  - **Data Table Interpretation:**
    - Look for the indirect effect coefficient to assess the mediating role.
    - Check for significance to determine whether mediation is supported.
    - Consider the size and direction of the indirect effect.

- **Moderation Analysis:**
  - **Description:**
    - **Objective:** Explore how relationships change under different conditions.
    - **Usefulness:** Moderation analysis is useful when examining whether the relationship between two variables is influenced by a third variable.
  - **Data Table Interpretation:**
    - Examine interaction terms between variables.
    - Evaluate the significance of interaction effects.
    - Consider interpreting the conditional effects based on significant interactions.

# IV. Tips 

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Ensure data meet assumptions of linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity.
  - **When** is it crucial to preprocess data before statistical analyses?

- **Interpretation:**
  - Focus on the significance of coefficients, R-squared values, and overall model fit.
  
- **Model Validation:**
  - Regularly check assumptions using visualizations and diagnostic tests.
  - **How** does ongoing validation contribute to the reliability of results?
